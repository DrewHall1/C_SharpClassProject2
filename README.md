CodeLou C# final project

This is just a little console app that allows you to choose some type of exercise from a basic list of Upper, Lower and Core exercises.
- You can choose an option to see a list of all exercises, or
- choose to add a new exercise to the list that will be on the list the next time you run through it
- you can also edit/overwrite any exercise by choosing the Id number next to it and making changes, then save
- there's also an option to Quit without doing anything
